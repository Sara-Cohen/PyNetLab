# PyNetLab

PyNetLab is a repository containing practical exercises completed during the Advanced Computer Networks course. These exercises are designed to reinforce theoretical understanding through hands-on implementation and experimentation with network protocols and programming concepts.

## Exercise Overview

1. **Socket Programming SMTP Client & Server**:
   - Demonstrates proficiency in socket programming in Python.
   - Implements a simple SMTP client and server to understand the basics of email communication over TCP/IP.

2. **Advanced Socket Exercise - Multi-User Chat**:
   - Expands on socket programming skills to create a multi-user chat application.
   - Illustrates concurrent communication and handling multiple client connections using sockets.

3. **DNS Protocol Exercise - Writing NSLOOKUP**:
   - Explores the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol and its role in translating domain names to IP addresses.
   - Implements a basic version of the NSLOOKUP tool to query DNS servers and resolve domain names.

4. **Encrypted Socket Creation Exercise**:
   - Introduces encryption principles in socket communication.
   - Develops a secure communication channel using encryption techniques similar to SSH.

5. **Final Assignment - DNStoolkit**:
   - Integrates knowledge from previous exercises to create a comprehensive DNS toolkit.
   - Combines socket programming, DNS protocol understanding, and encryption to build a versatile DNS tool.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain practical experience in protocol programming, particularly in Python.
- Understand fundamental networking concepts such as sockets, TCP/IP, DNS, and encryption.
- Develop proficiency in implementing network services like email, chat, and DNS tools.
- Learn to analyze network traffic and troubleshoot network issues using tools like Wireshark and Scapy.
- Apply software development best practices in writing efficient and maintainable code for networking applications.
